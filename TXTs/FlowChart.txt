1. Stand-By:
        (no faces detected)
        don't interrupt other events / movements
        center all layers (looking straight out of the window)
   if(face detected)
        enter 2.

2. Follow-Face:
        move all layers according to face movements
   if(no face detected anymore)
        enter 1.
   if(facePosition is in xy-coordinate-threshold for 5s)
        enter 3.
   if(facePosition is in x1y1-coordinate-threshold for 5s)
        enter X. 

3. Trigger train    
        move all layers according to face movements
        + start moving traing across the image (finish this movement no matter what)
   if(no face detected anymore)
        enter 1.
   if(train movement is done)
        enter 2. 
   if(facePosition is in x1y1-coordinate-threshold for 5s)
        enter X.
